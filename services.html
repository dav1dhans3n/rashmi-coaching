                        <h3>What is a Professional Life Coach?</h3>
                        A professional life coach is a trusted partner who can help you identify and uncover what keeps
                        you
                        from
                        reaching your fullest potential, while emphasizing your strengths. A life coach is
                        professionally
                        trained to help you maximize your full potential and reach your DESIRED results. They are like a
                        supportive friend and a trusted adviser rolled into one. It is a one-on-one relationship that
                        provides a
                        supportive and non-judgmental space to help you create what you want for yourself. You can find
                        a
                        Life
                        Coach to help you strategize and acquire the tools you need to achieve your goals. It consists
                        of
                        steps
                        to help you identify and reframe your thoughts and attitudes. It can also help you break
                        negative
                        habits, acquire new methods of identification, and take action to achieve your NEW version! <br>
                        <h3>What types of people have Life Coaches? </h3>
                        People from all walks of life work with professional coaches to help attain their goals. Life
                        Coaches
                        work with people in all areas of their life including relationships, career, finance, health and
                        more.
                        Working with a personal coach is not limited to any type of person, but is best for those who
                        want
                        to
                        take initiative in their own life. People who get a Life Coach are committed to a more fulfilled
                        life
                        and are willing to do the work needed to get there. <br>
                        <h3>How will Life Coaching help? </h3>
                        The results will vary depending on what brings you to a Life Coach. If you get a Life Coach to
                        help
                        you
                        out professionally, life coaching can help you make your current job more gratifying, gain
                        better
                        focus
                        on managing your work, and market yourself more effectively. If your reasons are personal, you
                        can
                        find
                        a life coach to help you improve your relationships, resolve ongoing negative behaviors, improve
                        your
                        overall health, and grow spirituality. With life coaching you can live a more balanced and
                        enhanced
                        life, and make your dreams come true! <br>
                        <h3>What happens in a Life Coaching Session? </h3>
                        Each session is tailored to the client and will vary based upon individual needs. In the
                        beginning,
                        we
                        will discuss what you are committed to accomplishing through our work together and begin to
                        create a
                        plan to achieve your goals. Periodically, I will give you assignments to help direct your
                        progress.
                        We
                        will work together to acknowledge obstacles, explore alternate perspectives and celebrate
                        successes.
                        With the conclusion of each session, we will revisit your goals and evaluate the next steps that
                        are
                        needed to achieve these results.<br>
                        <h3>Do I really need a personal Coach? Can't I just do it by myself? </h3>
                        Life coaching can take you above and beyond your own personal limitations. More often than not,
                        people
                        try to achieve their greatest potential, but don’t even realize what stands in their way. A
                        personal
                        Coach can offer an unbiased and objective perspective, and can help you realize your patterns
                        and
                        habits. Most people experience that they are more efficient when working with a Professional
                        Life
                        Coach
                        and that this provides the opportunity for them to better realize their potential. Life coaching
                        can
                        make your dreams attainable and will give you support and encouragement along the way. <br>
                        <h3>What is your cancellation policy?</h3>
                        I require a 24 hour notice to cancel all sessions. Please be sure to contact me if you will not
                        be
                        able
                        to make your scheduled appointment in order to avoid being charged for the session. <br>
                        <h3>How long do people generally work with a Life Coach?</h3>
                        To experience the effectiveness of a life coaching program, I suggest clients make an initial
                        three-month commitment. At the end of the three months, we will evaluate progress and discuss
                        options
                        for continued coaching. <br>
                        <h3>Is personal life coaching confidential? </h3>
                        What we discuss will be held in confidence and not shared with others. However, our discussions
                        are
                        not
                        privileged for legal purposes. <br>

                <p class="lead">Here's how it works
                    A Clarity Session is all about what you are looking for, goals you want to reach, challenges you
                    have,
                    how I can help and if what I offer will meet your needs.

                    Personal development is an empowering discovery of your SELF. This is where your honesty meets your
                    Courage, Curiosity and Creativity.

                    I'm here to guide and support you through the framework and strategies where you have an opportunity
                    to
                    discover what it is you need to realize your own vision for life.

                    Here are a few things to think through before starting a coaching program:
                    Are you motivated to make changes, step outside of your comfort zone and take action?
                    Are you open to receiving reflective and constructive feedback? Sometimes this means letting go of
                    current thought patterns and being open to transformation.

                    Are you willing to invest time and energy into honoring yourself?

                    Creating lasting change is an "inside job" entailing a shift of mindset and establishing new
                    patterns.

                <h2 class="acc-heading">Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique</h2>
                <p class="lead">What is QHHT?
                    Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT) was developed over 50 years by Dolores Cannon.

                    QHHT® is a powerful tool to access that all knowing part of ourselves that has been called The
                    Higher
                    Self, The Oversoul, even the Soul itself. When we incarnate on Earth we forget our previous lives
                    and
                    connection to our souls and The Source. Sometimes mental and physical ailments are rooted in trauma
                    from
                    past lives; sometimes they are connected to lessons being learned in a person’s present life. The
                    Higher
                    Self reveals the cause and will assist according to any soul’s particular lessons.

                    QHHT® achieves the deepest level of hypnosis possible, the Somnambulistic level of trance. The
                    Somnambulistic state is ordinarily experienced two times a day: just before becoming awake and just
                    before falling asleep.

                    Let’s discuss the difference between the conscious and the subconscious mind. Here is a simple way
                    to
                    look at it. It has been said many times that we humans use only about 10% of our brain.
                    What is really meant by this is that the conscious mind needs about 10% of our brain’s resources. In
                    other words, thinking, moving about, making choices, planning, seeing, hearing, tasting, touching,
                    and
                    smelling are all conscious activities, and take up 10% of the processing power of our brain. What is
                    the
                    other 90% of the brain doing? If the conscious mind takes up 10% of your brain, we can refer to the
                    other 90% as the subconscious mind. This silent and unconscious majority of the brain is constantly
                    busy
                    storing information and keeping your body systems running efficiently. It is also important to
                    understand that the subconscious mind exerts an unseen, yet profound influence over the things we
                    do,
                    and how we behave and feel. Like a computer, your subconscious mind is capable of storing vast
                    amounts
                    of information.

                    When the Subconscious is contacted during a QHHT® session, observable changes occur in the subject
                    being
                    hypnotized, the practitioner, and anyone in the room: a dramatic increase in the perceptible energy
                    level causing feelings of joy and love. The primary concern of Dolores Cannon and every QHHT®
                    Practitioner was and is to always ensure the well-being of their subjects. Seeking the unlimited
                    assistance of the Subconscious, which knows every aspect of a person’s being, whether they are
                    conscious
                    of them or not, can help any person in amazing and unexpected ways.

                    Quantum Healing Hypnosis Service
                    A typical Quantum Healing Hypnosis session takes between 5-6 hours.

                    On the day of your session, you will have a list of questions that you want answered by your High
                    Self.

                    We’ll spend some time getting to know each other and your reasons for wanting this experience. We’ll
                    talk about how easy it is to be guided into this deep state of relaxation to let go and allow
                    yourself
                    to have the experience.

                    We’ll talk about your life’s journey and go over your list of questions.

                    Once we start the hypnosis process, you’ll be under for two hours or a little longer. This part of
                    the
                    session is recorded for you, as people remember varying amounts.

                    While in this deep state of relaxation you will be guided through 1-3 past lives or other
                    experiences
                    your soul has had.

                    If you don’t believe in past lives or you are unsure, we simply call it a story. Either way your
                    High
                    Self is lovingly taking you to the place where your questions and issues began.
                    You will gently be counted up and will discuss with you what occurred and what you remember.
                    We’ll listen to parts of experience and go over the answers you gave to your questions!

                    How to prepare for your session
                    Prepare a list of questions you would like your High Self to answer. Please print or write out
                    neatly
                    your list of questions; please don’t bring the list on a device like your phone or iPad.

                    The night before the day of your session don’t drink alcohol.
                    Eliminate or limit your use of caffeine the day of your session.
                    Eat well but light before you come in. Our session could go 6 hours or longer.

                    Your session is private and your confidentiality in all matters is observed. Because of this, no
                    friends
                    and/or family are allowed in your session. You may share your recording or any memories or thoughts
                    at
                    your discretion.

                    My intention is to assist you to receive the information you seek so that you can have a very happy
                    and
                    focused life.

                    I will do everything in our power to work for your greater good and give you the tools you need to
                    move
                    forward in your life in a happy, insightful and productive way.

                    I am simply your guide to show you that all answers lie within and are accessible by YOU!

                <h2 class="acc-heading">Akashic Records Readings </h2>
                <p class="lead">What are the Akashic Records?
                    Akasha (a-ka 'ska) is a Sanskrit word meaning "ether": all-pervasive space. Originally signifying
                    "radiation" or "brilliance," in Indian philosophy akasha was considered the first and most
                    fundamental
                    of the five elements - the others being vata (air), agni (fire), ap (water), and prithivi (earth).
                    Akasha embraces the properties of all five elements: it is the womb from which everything we
                    perceive
                    with our senses has emerged and into which everything will ultimately re-descend. The Akashic Record
                    (also called The Akashic Chronicle,) is the enduring record of all that happens, and has ever
                    happened,
                    in space and time.

                    For centuries, the Akashic Record has been the exclusive domain of mystics, scholars, and saints.
                    Rightfully so. Infinite power and wisdom are available in the Record, and they have been entrusted
                    to
                    those well-prepared for the responsibility of deep knowing. In the U.S., it was through the work of
                    Edgar Cayce in the early to mid-twentieth century (“The Sleeping Prophet”), that Akashic Records
                    readings became a familiar practice in the movement of consciousness development. Today, the Records
                    are
                    no longer the exclusive domain of saints, scholars, and mystics. The collective consciousness of
                    humanity has been growing, evolving, and maturing.

                    Contemporary physicist Ervin Laszlo explores concepts of Akasha from the perspective of science,
                    concluding that the Akasha contains templates for human ideals such as harmony and equanimity. This
                    is
                    reflected in his “Akasha Paradigm” which he relates to human evolutionary processes.

                    In this time of great change, the availability of the Record is shifting. The light of the Spirit is
                    pouring into human consciousness at an unprecedented rate. This light infusion is causing radical
                    upheaval in all areas of life for the purpose of bringing us into the highest possible alignment
                    with
                    the Divine Reality. One of the great tools for the development of our consciousness is the Akashic
                    Record.

                    How do I access the Akashic Records?
                    I have been trained in and by my beloved teacher Dr Linda Howe's Pathway Prayer Process©. The Prayer
                    is
                    exceptionally powerful and unique in that enables seekers across the globe to not only “unlock” the
                    Records, but also to enter at the very heart, the seat of wisdom, of this vibrational dimension.

                    In the process of opening the Records for ourselves or others, we transition from a state of
                    ordinary
                    human consciousness to a state of Divine universal consciousness, in which we recognize our Oneness
                    with
                    the Divine at all levels. This allows us to perceive the impressions and vibrations of the Records.
                    And
                    so, the Records have served humanity by being an extraordinary state through which we can receive
                    Divine
                    illumination at a manageable rate — and integrate it into our human experience. Glimpses of Heaven
                    on
                    earth!

                    Your Akashic Records can only be accessed with your permission and are accessed down and in through
                    the
                    heart.

                    What can an Akashic Records Reading do for me?
                    Transformational life guidance is always available for you through the Akashic Records. Important
                    challenges in your life can be addressed and resolved by scheduling a consultation with me.

                    In an Akashic Records reading, we explore who you are, and the issues you face in this lifetime,
                    from
                    the perspective of your soul. We feel both known and loved within the Records. Being in the richness
                    of
                    this sacred realm can help us in every area of life, from creative endeavors to careers to
                    relationships
                    of every variety. This accepting, non-judgmental dimension fosters greater loving, compassion, and
                    harmony with life.

                    Most people get ready for their session by making a list of questions covering the main areas of
                    their
                    lives. Please see these comprehensive guidelines:
