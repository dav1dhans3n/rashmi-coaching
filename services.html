          <p class="lead">
            Hypnosis is making the subconscious conscious.<br />
            Hypnosis is a natural state of selective, focused attention, and,
            even though it is 100% natural and normal, it remains one of the
            most fascinating phenomena of the human mind. Our ability to enter
            this unique state of consciousness opens the door to countless
            possibilities for healing, self-exploration and change -

          <h4 class="acc-heading">What is QHHT?</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT) was developed over 50
            years by Dolores Cannon.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            QHHT® is a powerful tool to access that all knowing part of
            ourselves that has been called The Higher Self, The Oversoul, even
            the Soul itself. When we incarnate on Earth we forget our previous
            lives and connection to our souls and The Source. Sometimes mental
            and physical ailments are rooted in trauma from past lives;
            sometimes they are connected to lessons being learned in a person's
            present life. The Higher Self reveals the cause and will assist
            according to any soul's particular lessons.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            QHHT® achieves the deepest level of hypnosis possible, the
            Somnambulistic level of trance. The Somnambulistic state is
            ordinarily experienced two times a day: just before becoming awake
            and just before falling asleep.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Let's discuss the difference between the conscious and the
            subconscious mind. Here is a simple way to look at it. It has been
            said many times that we humans use only about 10% of our brain.<br />
            What is really meant by this is that the conscious mind needs about
            10% of our brain's resources. In other words, thinking, moving
            about, making choices, planning, seeing, hearing, tasting, touching,
            and smelling are all conscious activities, and take up 10% of the
            processing power of our brain. What is the other 90% of the brain
            doing? If the conscious mind takes up 10% of your brain, we can
            refer to the other 90% as the subconscious mind. This silent and
            unconscious majority of the brain is constantly busy storing
            information and keeping your body systems running efficiently. It is
            also important to understand that the subconscious mind exerts an
            unseen, yet profound influence over the things we do, and how we
            behave and feel. Like a computer, your subconscious mind is capable
            of storing vast amounts of information.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            When the Subconscious is contacted during a QHHT® session,
            observable changes occur in the subject being hypnotized, the
            practitioner, and anyone in the room: a dramatic increase in the
            perceptible energy level causing feelings of joy and love. The
            primary concern of Dolores Cannon and every QHHT® Practitioner was
            and is to always ensure the well-being of their subjects. Seeking
            the unlimited assistance of the Subconscious, which knows every
            aspect of a person's being, whether they are conscious of them or
            not, can help any person in amazing and unexpected ways.

                We'll spend some time getting to know each other and your
                reasons for wanting this experience. We'll talk about how easy
                it is to be guided into this deep state of relaxation to let go
                and allow yourself to have the experience.

                Once we start the hypnosis process, you'll be under for two
                hours or a little longer. This part of the session is recorded
                for you, as people remember varying amounts.
              </li>
              <li>
                While in this deep state of relaxation you will be guided

              <li>
                If you don't believe in past lives or you are unsure, we simply
                call it a story. Either way your Higher Self is lovingly taking
                you to the place where your questions and issues began.
              </li>
              <li>
                You will gently be counted up and will discuss with you what

          <h2 class="acc-title"><b>Akashic Records Reading</b></h2>
          <h4 class="acc-heading">What are the Akashic Records?</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            Akasha (a-ka 'ska) is a Sanskrit word meaning "ether": all-pervasive
            space. Originally signifying "radiation" or "brilliance," in Indian
            philosophy akasha was considered the first and most fundamental of
            the five elements - the others being vata (air), agni (fire), ap
            (water), and prithivi (earth). Akasha embraces the properties of all
            five elements: it is the womb from which everything we perceive with
            our senses has emerged and into which everything will ultimately
            re-descend. The Akashic Record (also called The Akashic Chronicle,)
            is the enduring record of all that happens, and has ever happened,
            in space and time.<br /><br />

            For centuries, the Akashic Record has been the exclusive domain of
            mystics, scholars, and saints. Rightfully so. Infinite power and
            wisdom are available in the Record, and they have been entrusted to
            those well-prepared for the responsibility of deep knowing. In the
            U.S., it was through the work of Edgar Cayce in the early to
            mid-twentieth century (“The Sleeping Prophet”), that Akashic Records
            readings became a familiar practice in the movement of consciousness
            development. Today, the Records are no longer the exclusive domain
            of saints, scholars, and mystics. The collective consciousness of
            humanity has been growing, evolving, and maturing.<br /><br />

            Contemporary physicist Ervin Laszlo explores concepts of Akasha from
            the perspective of science, concluding that the Akasha contains
            templates for human ideals such as harmony and equanimity. This is
            reflected in his “Akasha Paradigm” which he relates to human
            evolutionary processes.<br /><br />

            In this time of great change, the availability of the Record is
            shifting. The light of the Spirit is pouring into human
            consciousness at an unprecedented rate. This light infusion is
            causing radical upheaval in all areas of life for the purpose of
            bringing us into the highest possible alignment with the Divine
            Reality. One of the great tools for the development of our
            consciousness is the Akashic Record.<br />
          </p>
          <h4 class="acc-heading">How do I access the Akashic Records?</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            I have been trained in and by my beloved teacher Dr Linda Howe's
            Pathway Prayer Process©. The Prayer is exceptionally powerful and
            unique in that enables seekers across the globe to not only “unlock”
            the Records, but also to enter at the very heart, the seat of
            wisdom, of this vibrational dimension.<br /><br />

            In the process of opening the Records for ourselves or others, we
            transition from a state of ordinary human consciousness to a state
            of Divine universal consciousness, in which we recognize our Oneness
            with the Divine at all levels. This allows us to perceive the
            impressions and vibrations of the Records. And so, the Records have
            served humanity by being an extraordinary state through which we can
            receive Divine illumination at a manageable rate — and integrate it
            into our human experience. Glimpses of Heaven on earth!<br /><br />

            Your Akashic Records can only be accessed with your permission and
            are accessed down and in through the heart.<br />

            What can an Akashic Records Reading do for me?

          <p class="lead">
            Transformational life guidance is always available for you through
            Akashic Records. Important challenges in your life can be addressed

            In an Akashic Records reading, we explore who you are, and the
            issues you face in this lifetime, from the perspective of your soul.
            We feel both known and loved within the Records. Being in the
            richness of this sacred realm can help us in every area of life,
            from creative endeavors to careers to relationships of every
            variety. This accepting, non-judgmental dimension fosters greater
            loving, compassion, and harmony with life.<br /><br />
