                    <h3>What is a Professional Life Coach?</h3>
                    <p>A professional life coach is a trusted partner who can help you identify
                        and uncover what keeps you from reaching your fullest potential, while
                        emphasizing your strengths. A life coach is professionally trained to
                        help you maximize your full potential and reach your DESIRED results. <br>
                        It is a supportive one-on-one relationship, where we have the
                        uncomfortable conversations, the awkward conversations, the unbelievable
                        conversation, the unexpected conversation and the most transformative
                        conversations, that is where is the MIRACLES happens. And, they happen
                        every day.<br></p>

                    <h3>What types of people have Life Coaches? </h3>
                    <p>People from all walks of life work with professional coaches to help
                        attain their goals. Life Coaches work with people in all areas of their
                        life including relationships, career, finance, health and more. Working
                        with a personal coach is not limited to any type of person, but is best
                        for those who want to take initiative in their own life. <br>
                        I have an amazing coach I work with, because everyone needs one to get
                        to their next level and we all have blind spots.<br></p>

                    <h3>How will Life Coaching help? </h3>
                    <p>The results will vary depending on what brings you to a Life Coach. If
                        you get a Life Coach to help you out professionally, life coaching can
                        help you make your current job more gratifying, gain better focus on
                        managing your work, and market yourself more effectively. If your reasons
                        are personal, you can find a life coach to help you improve your
                        relationships, resolve ongoing negative behaviors, improve your overall
                        health, and grow spirituality. With life coaching you can live a more
                        balanced and enhanced life, and make your dreams come true! <br></p>

                    <h3>What happens in a Life Coaching Session? </h3>
                    <p>Each session is tailored to the client and will vary based upon individual
                        needs. In the beginning, we will discuss what you are committed to
                        accomplishing through our work together and begin to create a plan to
                        achieve your goals. <br></p>

                    <h3>Do I really need a personal Coach? Can't I just do it by myself? </h3>
                    <p>Life coaching can take you above and beyond your own personal limitations.
                        More often than not, people try to achieve their greatest potential,
                        but don’t even realize what stands in their way. A personal Coach can
                        offer an unbiased and objective perspective, and can help you realize
                        your patterns and habits. <br></p>

                    <h3>What is Hypnosis?</h3>
                    <p>Hypnosis is making the subconscious conscious.<br>
                        Hypnosis is a natural state of selective, focused attention, and,
                        even though it is 100% natural and normal, it remains one of the
                        most fascinating phenomena of the human mind. Our ability to enter
                        this unique state of consciousness opens the door to countless
                        possibilities for healing, self-exploration and change -

                        <h3>What is QHHT?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT) was developed over 50
                            years by Dolores Cannon.
                        </p>
                        <p>QHHT® is a powerful tool to access that all knowing part of ourselves
                            that has been called The Higher Self, The Oversoul, even the Soul
                            itself. When we incarnate on Earth we forget our previous lives
                            and connection to our souls and The Source. Sometimes mental and
                            physical ailments are rooted in trauma from past lives; sometimes
                            they are connected to lessons being learned in a person’s present
                            life. The Higher Self reveals the cause and will assist according
                            to any soul’s particular lessons.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            QHHT® achieves the deepest level of hypnosis possible, the Somnambulistic
                            level of trance. The Somnambulistic state is ordinarily experienced
                            two times a day: just before becoming awake and just before falling asleep.
                        </p>
                        <p>Let’s discuss the difference between the conscious and the subconscious
                            mind. Here is a simple way to look at it. It has been said many times
                            that we humans use only about 10% of our brain.<br>
                            What is really meant by this is that the conscious mind needs about
                            10% of our brain’s resources. In other words, thinking, moving about,
                            making choices, planning, seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and
                            smelling are all conscious activities, and take up 10% of the
                            processing power of our brain. What is the other 90% of the brain
                            doing? If the conscious mind takes up 10% of your brain, we can refer
                            to the other 90% as the subconscious mind. This silent and unconscious
                            majority of the brain is constantly busy storing information and
                            keeping your body systems running efficiently. It is also important
                            to understand that the subconscious mind exerts an unseen, yet
                            profound influence over the things we do, and how we behave and feel.
                            Like a computer, your subconscious mind is capable of storing vast
                            amounts of information.
                        </p>
                        <p>When the Subconscious is contacted during a QHHT® session, observable changes occur in the
                            subject being hypnotized, the practitioner, and anyone in the room: a dramatic increase in
                            the perceptible energy level causing feelings of joy and love. The primary concern of
                            Dolores Cannon and every QHHT® Practitioner was and is to always ensure the well-being of
                            their subjects. Seeking the unlimited assistance of the Subconscious, which knows every
                            aspect of a person’s being, whether they are conscious of them or not, can help any person
                            in amazing and unexpected ways.

                        <p>
                            A typical Quantum Healing Hypnosis session takes between 5-6 hours.<br><br>
                            On the day of your session, you will have a list of questions that you
                            want answered by your High Self.<br><br>
                            We’ll spend some time getting to know each other and your reasons for wanting this
                            experience. We’ll talk about how easy it is to be guided into this deep state of relaxation
                            to let go and allow yourself to have the experience.<br><br>
                            We’ll talk about your life’s journey and go over your list of questions.<br><br>
                            Once we start the hypnosis process, you’ll be under for two hours or a little longer. This
                            part of the session is recorded for you, as people remember varying amounts.<br><br>
                            While in this deep state of relaxation you will be guided through 1-3 past lives or other
                            experiences your soul has had.<br><br>
                            If you don’t believe in past lives or you are unsure, we simply call it a story. Either way
                            your High Self is lovingly taking you to the place where your questions and issues
                            began.<br><br>
                            You will gently be counted up and will discuss with you what occurred and what you
                            remember.<br><br>
                            We’ll listen to parts of experience and go over the answers you gave to your questions!<br>

                    <h3>What are the Akashic Records?</h3>
                    <p>Akasha (a-ka 'ska) is a Sanskrit word meaning "ether": all-pervasive space. Originally signifying
                        "radiation" or "brilliance," in Indian philosophy akasha was considered the first and most
                        fundamental of the five elements - the others being vata (air), agni (fire), ap (water), and
                        prithivi (earth). Akasha embraces the properties of all five elements: it is the womb from which
                        everything we perceive with our senses has emerged and into which everything will ultimately
                        re-descend. The Akashic Record (also called The Akashic Chronicle,) is the enduring record of
                        all that happens, and has ever happened, in space and time.<br><br>

                        For centuries, the Akashic Record has been the exclusive domain of mystics, scholars, and
                        saints. Rightfully so. Infinite power and wisdom are available in the Record, and they have been
                        entrusted to those well-prepared for the responsibility of deep knowing. In the U.S., it was
                        through the work of Edgar Cayce in the early to mid-twentieth century (“The Sleeping Prophet”),
                        that Akashic Records readings became a familiar practice in the movement of consciousness
                        development. Today, the Records are no longer the exclusive domain of saints, scholars, and
                        mystics. The collective consciousness of humanity has been growing, evolving, and
                        maturing.<br><br>

                        Contemporary physicist Ervin Laszlo explores concepts of Akasha from the perspective of science,
                        concluding that the Akasha contains templates for human ideals such as harmony and equanimity.
                        This is reflected in his “Akasha Paradigm” which he relates to human evolutionary
                        processes.<br><br>

                        In this time of great change, the availability of the Record is shifting. The light of the
                        Spirit is pouring into human consciousness at an unprecedented rate. This light infusion is
                        causing radical upheaval in all areas of life for the purpose of bringing us into the highest
                        possible alignment with the Divine Reality. One of the great tools for the development of our
                        consciousness is the Akashic Record.<br>

                        <br></p>
                    <h3>How do I access the Akashic Records?</h3>
                    <p>I have been trained in and by my beloved teacher Dr Linda Howe's Pathway Prayer Process©. The
                        Prayer is exceptionally powerful and unique in that enables seekers across the globe to not only
                        “unlock” the Records, but also to enter at the very heart, the seat of wisdom, of this
                        vibrational dimension.<br><br>

                        In the process of opening the Records for ourselves or others, we transition from a state of
                        ordinary human consciousness to a state of Divine universal consciousness, in which we recognize
                        our Oneness with the Divine at all levels. This allows us to perceive the impressions and
                        vibrations of the Records. And so, the Records have served humanity by being an extraordinary
                        state through which we can receive Divine illumination at a manageable rate — and integrate it
                        into our human experience. Glimpses of Heaven on earth!<br><br>

                        Your Akashic Records can only be accessed with your permission and are accessed down and in
                        through the heart.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>Transformational life guidance is always available for you through the Akashic Records. Important
                        challenges in your life can be addressed and resolved by scheduling a consultation with
                        me.<br><br>

                        In an Akashic Records reading, we explore who you are, and the issues you face in this lifetime,
                        from the perspective of your soul. We feel both known and loved within the Records. Being in the
                        richness of this sacred realm can help us in every area of life, from creative endeavors to
                        careers to relationships of every variety. This accepting, non-judgmental dimension fosters
                        greater loving, compassion, and harmony with life.<br><br>
