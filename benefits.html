          22 Awesome Benefits of Coaching at Conscious, Subconscious, and
          Superconscious Levels
        </h2>
        <hr class="featurette-divider" />
        <h3 class="acc-heading">1. Better self-confidence</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          A study by the International Coaching Federation (IFC) discovered that
          80% of people who hired a life coach reported improved
          self-confidence.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">2. A different perspective</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          We are often consumed by our own opinions, life experiences, and way
          of thinking. A life coach can provide a new and often helpful
          perspective on things.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">3. Heightened self-awareness</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Being fully aware of your impact on others and recognizing your flaws,
          strengths, and unique personality attributes is an extremely
          challenging adventure. This is the art of self-awareness.
          Self-awareness requires a strong capacity for introspection and
          reflection, something which a life coach can help you work towards.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">4. Improved quality of your relationships</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Relationships are the glue that combines individuals with society and
          provides shared fulfillment in life. From marriages to friendships and
          beyond, strong relationships are a critical contributor to happiness.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">5. Achieve goals</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          We all have dreams in life, but very few people crystallize these
          aspirations into tangible goals to systematically accomplish. A major
          benefit of life coaching is being able to define your life goals and
          create a concrete, doable plan to achieve them.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">6. Find happiness</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          True happiness is somewhat of a mystical experience and for most
          people, it’s hard to imagine a life that is forever happy. At the end
          of the day, happiness is intrinsic, it’s a feeling that is unique to
          the way you feel inside. By defining life goals, creating balance, and
          committing to a better version of yourself with the aid of a life
          coach, you open up the prospect of finding happiness.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">7. Discover clarity of purpose</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Are you clear on what your purpose in life is? Again, this is a very
          individual and internal fire that burns within. It’s your passion,
          dreams, skills, and weaknesses all bundled into one. It’s your
          direction in life. Clarity of purpose is vital if you want to pursue
          your dreams, a life coach can assist you in creating this focus.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">8. Follow through on commitments</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Hiring a life coach is about more than just getting advice and
          guidance, it also creates accountability. You will have an ally that
          holds you to your word and ensures those goals get pursued and
          projects are completed.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">9. Discover your best self</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Many of us spend too much time comparing ourselves to others and
          focusing on what we perceive to be our flaws. Discovering your best
          self is one of the priceless benefits of life coaching.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">10. Overcome your fears</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          By minimizing negative thoughts and embracing your strengths you can
          start to overcome fears that have been restricting your ability to
          achieve your dreams.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">11. Determine your strengths and weaknesses</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          A life coach will take an impartial view of your strengths and
          weaknesses, helping you understand your areas of greatest opportunity.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">12. Unlock potential</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Many of us have latent potential that is hidden by prejudice or
          closed-mindedness. Life coaches unlock this potential by opening you
          up to alternate ways of thinking and creating clarity for your
          direction in life.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">13. Improve communication</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Most people who hire a life coach improve their communication skills.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">14. Manage time and productivity</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Everyone has the same amount of time in the day, but some people use
          those 24 hours more efficiently than others. Working with a life coach
          can help you better manage your time, set priorities, and get more
          done.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">
          15. Eliminate negative thoughts and overcome your fears
        </h4>
        <p class="lead">
          As well as looking at the positive aspects of life, such as your
          purpose, goals, and potential, life coaches are armed with a series of
          techniques that can help you eliminate or reduce negative thoughts
          that hold you back.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">16. Produce higher income</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          The skills you develop while working with a life coach will focus your
          resources while pursuing career goals or growing your business to new
          heights. This is one of the key benefits of coaching in a business
          environment.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">17. Eliminate bad habits</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          When bad habits are embedded in our day-to-day life, they diminish our
          ability to perform. Working with an impartial third party will help
          you determine what these habits may be and learn to eliminate them.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">18. Better decision making</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Despite thinking that we act rationally, most people make decisions
          based on emotion or entirely subconscious processes. With a deeper
          understanding of how the mind works, you can reframe the process of
          decision-making so that it becomes simpler and wiser.
        </p>

        <h4 class="acc-heading">19. Show more appreciation</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Showing appreciation and gratitude is a core component of fostering
          relationships. It makes people feel good about the impact they have on
          your life – be that in a corporate environment or socially.
          <br /><br />
          A life coach understands the importance of appreciation and has the
          tools to help you use it more effectively in your day-to-day life.
        </p>
        <h4 class="acc-heading">20. Improve physical well-being</h4>

          support. They can also work with you to create and execute a plan for
          improving your physical well-being or losing weight. A healthy body
          often results in a healthy mind too.

          Financial burdens, career-related issues, or personal relationship
          problems can result in mental instability and stress-related health
          concerns. Life coaches have access to relaxation techniques, which can
