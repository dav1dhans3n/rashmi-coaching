        <h4 class="acc-heading">REGULATIONS:</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy are legal, recognized, and Federally
          unregulated industries. However, Texas is one of very few states that
          adds any oversight. The Texas legislature decided that hypnotherapists
          without a degree in psychology or psychiatry must refer to themselves
          as hypnotists, and claim that their services are for “entertainment
          purposes.” Therefore, regardless of my certifications, I refer to
          myself as a Hypnotist on this website.
