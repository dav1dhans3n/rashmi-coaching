          Quantum Healing Hypnosis Session & Akashic Records Sessions
          Testimonials
        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Rohini is an extraordinary healer. She has a special gift of being
          really easy to talk to, easily conversational, all while being
          connected to some very high wisdom. With Rohini, it's as if the
          heavens and Earth have merged into one being. She's a wonderful
          balance of being very kind and healing and being very powerful &
          profound. Whether it be an Akashic record reading, or Quantum healing,
          she is absolutely, unequivocally, without doubt worth working with -
          <b>JS, Acupuncturist, Arizona</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Rohini is a gifted and intuitive Akashic Records practitioner. The
          insights and information I received during my sessions with her have
          been so valuable in helping me navigate relationship challenges and
          transitions in my life where I needed clarity. I highly recommend
          Rohini to anyone who is seeking answers -
          <b> AG, Lawyer, New Jersey</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          I had a revealing experience with Rohini. Not only was the date and
          time of our QHHT incredibly synchronistic but also meaningful. The
          date and time aligned with the content of the session. What more can
          you ask. Rohini is patient, a good listener and a great facilitator.
          She knew when to ask more questions and when to get me out of certain
          remembrance of past experiences. Three years later I still go back to
          the recording and discover new aspects to it. Other aspects are still
          unfolding. Thank you, Rohini - <b>AT, Professor, Romania</b>

        <p class="lead">
          I waited some time to write a review on my Quantum Healing session
          with Rohini in order to formulate my thoughts on the deeply impactful
          treatment that she so lovingly guided me through. During a period of
          feeling stuck in my life due to some unresolved issues that laid
          beneath my conscious mind, I came across the practice of Quantum
          Healing and was delighted to discover that a certified facilitator
          lived minutes away from me in Pennsylvania. After reaching out to
          Rohini, she carefully prepared me for our session by providing me with
          a questionnaire so that I might set my intentions before I met her in
          person. Upon meeting her in for our session, her personal warmth and
          thoughtful demeanor set me at ease which allowed me to fully embrace
          her process of discovery. The session itself was very relaxing and
          felt as if it was only fifteen minutes but was actually more than two
          hours. Following the hypnotic part of our session, Rohini spent a
          great deal of time allowing me to awaken and to talk about my feelings
          about the information that emerged from the inner recesses of my soul.
          She then set a clear path for me by charting a course of action for me
          to integrate the findings of my treatment over the coming weeks. When
          I left Rohini's office, I felt refreshed, unburdened, and excited to
          explore the themes that arose during out time together. Later that
          evening I enjoyed the most restful twelve hours of sleep in my entire
          life. As I continued to reflect on what came forth from me, Rohini
          sent a recording of our Quantum Healing session to me and links for
          information critical to my healing process. I can't recommend Rohini's
          Quantum Healing sessions enough! She is a truly gifted healer, coach,
          and guide who has helped me to rediscover these very same qualities in
          myself. I am so blessed to have found her at this period in my life -

          What I appreciate most about Rohini is her ability to challenge her
          clients in a supportive manner. She is an active listener who takes
          the time to understand the client's needs, strengths, and weaknesses.
          She then tailors her approach to ensure the client maximizes their
          potential and reaches their desired outcomes -

          the way. Her approach fosters creativity and innovation, encouraging
          clients to think outside the box and generate fresh ideas -
