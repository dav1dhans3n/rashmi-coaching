      <h2 class="featurette-heading text-center">Why was it so hard just being me?</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="lead col-sm">
          <p>Being rebellious, brave, questioning complacency, wanting to have
            uncomfortable conversations, wanting to be the change I wanted to
            see in the world…these were some of the questions I contemplated in
            my youth in India and they continued to haunt me as I migrated to the US. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="lead col-sm">
          <p>Altering the status quo in every phase of my life made me an outcast.
            Deeply wounded, I started questioning and blindly chasing the purpose
            and meaning of suffering, of discrimination, of love and the claim of
            the existence of “God”. This quest left me utterly lonely in a foreign
            country. Even though my inner world was crumbling what kept me afloat
            was that my outer world was flourishing in the IT industry.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lead col-sm">
          <p>Due to my innate nature of being trusting, naïve, true to myself and
            making heart led choices, I experienced intense personal losses which
            left me severely depressed in a foreign country with suicidal thoughts.
            It was during this time that I contemplated suicide. While I was
            experiencing these darkest moments of my life, I had a “spontaneous
            spiritual awakening” which left me in a state of unconditionally love
            & euphoria for months, ending my suffering.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading text-center">My Awakening...</h2>
        <div class="lead col-sm">
          <p>Due to the awakening experience and with the help of many modalities
            like, life coaching strategies by Tony Robbins & Chloe Maddanes, Akashic
            Records sessions by Linda Howe and QHHT sessions by Cannon Dolores, I
            was able to find light, which helped me to create a life that I desired
            and loved.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="lead col-sm">
          <p>It’s through my experiences that I have learned to live a conscious
            life filled with love, compassion and clarity. Being deeply rooted in
            the truth of existence has also guided me through tribulations, such as
            the loss of loved ones, with grace and understanding.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="lead col-sm">
          <p>I am grateful for the gift of creating sacred spaces where people feel
            safe to show their vulnerable side, appreciate being seen, heard and
            understood. This gift is a critical asset which allows me to assist
            and guide individuals as they journey the unknowns of their life with
            a lot more love, compassion, clarity and confidence.</p>
