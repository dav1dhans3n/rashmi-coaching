                As an Engineer, a former Corporate Leader and an intense
                lifelong student of Human Behaviour & Metaphysical Healing, I
                have lived and worked in multiple countries, have embraced
                multiple religions, adapted to multiple cultures and learned
                numerous healing modalities from the best teachers around the
                world. <br /><br />
                <img
                  class="me-image"
                  src="img/rashmi-full.jpg"
                  alt="image of me standing"
                />

                My personal journey has been excruciating. I have experienced
                gender and caste discrimination. I have experienced emotional
                and psychological manipulation and abuse by toxic people. I have
                been divorced. I have struggled financially by trusting the
                wrong people. I have struggled with the grief of losing loved
                ones. I have been lonely and I have been lost.
                <br /><br />

                That excruciating life came to an end at the age of 33, when I
                was in a suicidal state and experienced a “<b
                  >Spontaneous Spiritual Awakening</b
                >” leaving me in an indescribable state of unconditional love &
                euphoria for months after. This awakening was the beginning of a
                new powerful self realized life. Since then I have polished my
                inherent gifts, reprogrammed my subconscious mind and used the
                laws of the universe to live a fulfilling life every single day.
                <br /><br />

                After working with different modalities like Pranic Healing,
                Strategic Life Coaching, and Akashic Records Readings & Hypnosis
                for over 15 years on myself and to help my clients, I have
                realized that the simplest, the most powerful and fastest way to
                change our mindset and enjoy a better life is by
                <b>REPROGRAMMING OUR SUBCONSCIOUS MINDS</b> with Hypnosis.
                <br /><br />

                I have helped, educated, coached and empowered people, who have
                been in confused or miserable states, struggle with identity
                crisis, have been in religious cults, have abusive parents, have
                insomnia, struggle with the aftermath of divorce, have financial
                roadblocks, have anxiety, are grieving a loved one, have various
                addictions and other life-changing experiences.<br /><br />

                I am gifted in creating safe spaces naturally, my clients feel
                safe to have the most uncomfortable conversations, be truly
                vulnerable and experience the healing effect of being heard,
                seen and understood - many times for the first time in their
                entire lives.<br /><br />

                <b>YOU</b> are the greatest story you will ever <b>KNOW.</b
                ><br />
                <b>YOU</b> are the most important person in your <b>LIFE.</b
                ><br />
                <b>YOUR AUTHENTICITY</b> is your <b>SUPERPOWER.</b><br /><br />

                Love,<br />
